# DBIx::Thorm - an do it yourself ORM

* **DBIx::Thorm::Record:**
Start at dumb records with autogenerated save & load methods.
Who needs more anyway? Everything else is on a higher level.

* **DBIx::Thorm::Source:**
Build data source objects representing flat tables - not even an RDBMS needed.
It just so happens that relational databases are good at this, too.

* **SQL::Decorate:**
The best DSL for SQL is SQL. Just extend the placeholder syntax because
simple placehorders are sometimes not enough.

* **Data::Criteria:**
Overload comparisons & logic operators to build complex criteria.
